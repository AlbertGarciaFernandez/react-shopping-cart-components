# Assembler School: React Shopping Cart Project

> In this project you will learn how to create a React.js app step-by-step.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes.

See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### The repository

First, you will need to `clone` or `fork` the repository into your Github
account:

<img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/fork_button.jpg" alt="Fork on GitHub" width='450'>

```
$ git clone https://github.com/assembler-school/react-shopping-cart-project.git
```

## Contents and Branches Naming Strategy

The repository is made up of several branches that include the contents of each
section.

The branches follow a naming strategy like the following:

- `{NN}-{section-name}`: includes the main contents and the instructions of the
  section
- `{NN}-{section-name}-solution`: includes the solution of the section

### Fetching all Branches

In order to fetch all the remote branches in the repository, you can use the
following command:

```sh
$ git fetch --all
```

# List both remote-tracking branches and local branches

```sh
$ git branch --all
```

Then, you can create a local branch based on a remote branch with the following
command:

```sh
$ git checkout -b <new_branch_name> <remote_branch_name>
```

### Installing

First, you will need to install the dependencies with: `npm install`.

Run the following command in your terminal after cloning the main repo:

```sh
$ npm install
```
